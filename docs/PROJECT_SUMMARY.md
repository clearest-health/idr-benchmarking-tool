# IDR Benchmarking Tool - Project Summary

## Overview

Successfully built a complete IDR benchmarking platform that allows healthcare providers to compare their Independent Dispute Resolution performance against peers. The system transitions from the initial Python/Excel approach to a scalable PostgreSQL database with a modern Next.js frontend.

- **Lookup Tables**: Normalized specialties, states, practice sizes, service codes
- **Materialized Views**: Pre-aggregated performance summaries for speed
- **Stored Functions**: Optimized benchmarking calculations
- **Indexes**: Strategic indexing for fast filtering by specialty, geography, size

### 2. Data Migration (`migrate_data_to_postgres.py`)
- **Excel-to-PostgreSQL**: Automated migration of Federal IDR PUF data
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles numeric conversions, null values, text normalization
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient insertion with progress tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of data quality issues
- **Statistics**: Post-migration validation and reporting

### 3. Next.js Frontend (`idr-benchmarking-app/`)
- **Modern UI**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time filtering and analysis
- **Charts & Visualizations**: Recharts integration for performance comparison
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components

### 4. API Layer
- **Benchmarking Endpoint**: `/api/benchmark` for performance calculations
- **Filters Endpoint**: `/api/filters` for dropdown options
- **Supabase Integration**: Direct PostgreSQL queries with RLS support
